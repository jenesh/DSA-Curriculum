  Know how to find a plausible answer independently: Identify essential requirements that define the answer that needs to be solved, based on users, stakeholders, and constraints, single out missing information and determine the best way to find it, whether through existing resources, an online search, available libraries, etc., sort through varied information to determine what’s useful and reliable, and use those resources to learn something new, figure out a problem, and/ or locate additional helpful resources.

  Deal effectively with dead ends, frustration: Demonstrate ability to overcome frustration effectively. When one approach doesn’t work, rather than becoming despondent or giving up, able to take a step back, regroup, and try a different way.

## 1. What is whiteboarding?

The interview process typically includes the following steps:

1. Phone Screen
2. Take-home coding challenge
3. In-person interview

The in-person interview will typically comprise of questions about iOS development as well as one or two data structure/algorithm questions.

Traditionally, you will be asked to solve these problems on a whiteboard, without the use of an IDE.  Some companies don't ask whiteboarding questions at all, and some ask it during the phone screen.

You'll have about a half hour or so to solve a question that your interviewer presents.  Depending on the scale of the problem, they might not expect you to come to a full solution.

## 2. Why do companies have a whiteboarding method?

Companies that use whiteboarding interviews use them as a proxy for you problem solving, coding and communication abilities.  They rarely care about the specific problem that you are solving, they are more interesting in getting to know your thought process and how you approach questions.

Why DSA questions?  Traditionally, most people in software development first obtained a 4-year computer science degree.  That curriculum focuses heavily on DSA as the building blocks of computation.  When interviewing a candidate, the interviewer had reason to believe that they both had the same background in CS and could use those questions almost like logic questions to get a sense of general aptitude.

Of course, knowledge of DSA will make you a more knowledgeable programmer in general.  Many companies hold that these questions are still relevant because they want to hire engineers who have a solid foundation in CS fundamentals.

There is a growing divide between companies that use the traditional whiteboarding interview and companies that only ask platform specific problems.  We want to ensure that you are prepared for any interview questions that might arise.

## 3. Whiteboarding process

 1. Clarify the problem/Ask questions.
 2. Take note of Inputs, Outputs and Edge cases.
 3. Outline/Diagram a Solution: Pseudocode.
 4. Code your Solution.
 5. Test and Refactor your Code.
 6. Discuss Time and Space Complexity: Big-O notation.

## Practice & Demo
### Instructor Demo example:

Instructor demonstrate how to go through the whiteboarding process for the following question:

**Question:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

### Fellow volunteer whiteboarding question

Volunteer Fellow comes up to the board to attempt to solve the problem with the whiteboarding process:

**Question**: Find the second largest element in an array of numbers.

### Pair whiteboarding questions
Fellows pair up and work on the following question following the whiteboarding process.

#### Set One

1. Write a program that logs the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three log "Fizz" instead of that number, and for the multiples of five log "Buzz" instead of that number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five log "FizzBuzz" instead.
2. Write a program that logs out a given string with all of the vowels removed.

#### Set Two
3. Write a program that moves all of the 0s in a given array to the end.  The relative order of all other elements should remain the same.
4. Write a program that logs the largest product of two numbers in a given array.
