## Summary
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks that allow programmers to code and think at a higher level. Data structures are unique ways of organising and collecting data so that we can perform operations in an effective way. Algorithms are a set of instructions that solve hard problems in an efficient manner. Understanding DSA is critical for entry level interviews. DSA is usually technology agnostic so it instills a strong computer science mindset.

## Goals

- Students should be able to build and apply important Data Structures used in the real world.
- Students should be able to design and apply correct Algorithms for programming problems.
- Students should get a basic sense of "abstract data structures" and how the flow of data occurs in applications.
- Students should begin to understand efficiency of code and learn to code beyond the "brute force" route.
- Students should be able to problem solve at a high level during whiteboarding interviews.
